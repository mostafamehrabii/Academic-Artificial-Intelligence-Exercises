### Finding Similar Images Using the Locality-Sensitive Hashing Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to use the **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** algorithm for efficiently finding similar images in a dataset. Instead of comparing every image pair directly, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets, LSH reduces the complexity by hashing images into buckets where similar images are more likely to collide.

### Key Features:
1. **Feature Extraction:** 
   - Uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to extract feature vectors from images.
2. **LSH Implementation:**
   - Implements **Bucketed Random Projection LSH** from scratch to group similar images.
3. **Similarity Search:**
   - Provides fast retrieval of images similar to a given input image.
4. **Efficiency:** 
   - Reduces computational cost compared to brute-force search.

### How It Works:
1. Preprocess and extract features from the dataset.
2. Hash images into buckets using LSH.
3. Given a query image, find its bucket and retrieve similar images.

### Use Cases:
- Image de-duplication
- Content-based image retrieval
- Clustering and grouping images based on visual similarity

### Prerequisites:
- Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

### Setup:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Follow the instructions in the `Finding_Similar_Images_Using_the_Locality_Sensitive_Hashing_Algorithm.ipynb` file to run the project.
