# MNIST Classification with Naive Bayes and Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the implementation of various classification models using the MNIST dataset. The models range from Naive Bayes classifiers to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for performance comparison and enhancement.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for all implementations. It contains images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) with corresponding labels.
