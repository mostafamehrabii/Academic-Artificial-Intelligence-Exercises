**Explanation of the Code: Training an MLP Model for FashionMNIST Classification using PyTorch**

In this project, the **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model is trained on the **FashionMNIST** dataset using the PyTorch library. Below are the key steps explained:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The **FashionMNIST** dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel images of clothing items, is used.
   - The data is transformed into tensors and normalized to scale pixel values between [-1, 1].
   - The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

2. **Building the MLP Model:**
   - The model consists of four fully connected layers.
   - The layers have 512, 256, 128, and 10 neurons, respectively, with the final layer matching the number of classes (10 classes).
   - **ReLU** activation is used for the hidden layers, and **Softmax** is used for the output layer.

3. **Defining the Loss Function and Optimizer:**
   - **CrossEntropyLoss** is used as the loss function for this classification problem.
   - The **Adam** optimizer is chosen to update the model parameters.

4. **Training the Model:**
   - The model is trained for a specified number of epochs.
   - In each epoch, the model is trained on batches of the data, and the loss is calculated and updated.

5. **Evaluating the Model:**
   - After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set.
   - The accuracy of the model on the validation data is calculated and displayed.

This model can be used for classifying similar images, and further optimizations such as **dropout** or **batch normalization** can be applied to improve its performance.
