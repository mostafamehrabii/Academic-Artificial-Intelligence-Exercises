This code implements a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** model for classifying **FashionMNIST** images. The following steps are carried out in the code:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The FashionMNIST dataset is loaded and converted to tensor format.
   - The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

2. **MLP Model Definition:**
   - The model consists of four fully connected layers with decreasing neurons.
   - The hidden layers use **ReLU activation**.

3. **Model Training:**
   - The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **CrossEntropyLoss**.
   - After each epoch, the modelâ€™s accuracy on the validation set is calculated.

4. **Weight Pruning:**
   - Similar weights are pruned using similarity matrices.
   - After pruning, the model is retrained and evaluated.

5. **Evaluation of Pruning Impact:**
   - The accuracy of the model is evaluated across various pruning percentages.
   - A plot is generated to show the effect of pruning on validation accuracy.

6. **Area Under the Curve (AUC):**
   - The area under the curve (AUC) of accuracy versus pruning percentage is calculated to assess the effectiveness of the pruning strategy.

This code is designed to improve model efficiency by pruning unnecessary weights and analyzing the impact of pruning on validation accuracy.
