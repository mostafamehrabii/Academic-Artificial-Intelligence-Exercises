# Digit Clustering and Visualization Using Dimensionality Reduction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates clustering and visualization techniques on the digits dataset using various dimensionality reduction methods and K-Means clustering.

---

## **Features**
1. **Dataset:**
   - Utilizes the digits dataset (`sklearn.datasets.load_digits`) which contains handwritten digit images and their respective labels.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Applies PCA (Principal Component Analysis), ISOMAP, MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling), and LLE (Locally Linear Embedding) to reduce the dataset to 2D for visualization.

3. **Clustering:**
   - Implements K-Means clustering on the reduced data.
   - Evaluates clustering performance using Silhouette Score and inertia.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Visualizes reduced dimensions with clusters and evaluates clustering results.
   - Includes heatmaps and boxplots to analyze feature distributions across clusters.

5. **Advanced Analysis:**
   - Simulates hypothetical region and channel attributes to explore categorical distributions in clusters.

---

## **How to Run**
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
2. Ensure the required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run all the cells sequentially to execute the analysis and visualizations.

---

## **Outputs**
- 2D visualizations of the digits dataset using PCA, ISOMAP, MDS, and LLE.
- K-Means clustering results for each dimensionality reduction technique.
- Heatmaps and boxplots for deeper insights into cluster distributions.

This notebook is a comprehensive guide for exploring dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques on high-dimensional datasets.
